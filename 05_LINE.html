          <h2>
            MOTIVATION
          </h2>

          Now that smartphones have become a necessity,
          mobile messenger service is one of the best elements that can show the characteristics of modern society.
          LINE is a company that provides various services based on mobile messenger.
          We cannot help but pay attention to the growing size of LINE all over Asia.
          'LINE Conference branding design' began with the concern of how to show and brand the image of the company
          as if it is leading the current society.

          <h2>
            CONCEPT OF DESIGN
          </h2>

          The year 2020 marks the ninth anniversary of Line Service's launch in 2011.
          Ahead of the 10th anniversary, I thought it was an important time to look back on the time so far and prepare for new changes.
          In addition, 2020 can be seen as the first year of the new era.
          <br>Therefore, '9', which means 'preparation' and 'change', are set as keywords.
          Considering the current position of LINE, which is developing new technologies and services such as blockchain,
          it was intended to use mathematical elements, and the concept was Sudoku, a number puzzle familiar with 9.
