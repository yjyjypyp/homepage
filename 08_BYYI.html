          <h2>
            MOTIVATION
          </h2>

          With the creation of new technologies and various applications,
          the method of implementing video has diversified and new forms of exhibition have become possible.
           We tried to provide people with entertainment by producing content that fits in at the center of the change.
           Unlike the previous screening, we developed our thoughts by considering the characteristics of this exhibition,
           being that the audience moves and watches the work.
           <br>
           While considering contents that could hold a moving audience,
           I remembered the theme of the sculpture exhibition, ‘Design Connect (Collect, Connect, Play)’
           and we thought of an interactive design, a form in which the audience participated.
           <br><br>
           The biggest advantage of interactive design is that it can communicate with audiences.
           It can be said to design communication with the audience itself in that it is not a set video but a video created by the audience.
           We think these works can lead to a lot of participation in the work and create an understanding of the work as well as new experiences.
           <br><br>
           If all the ideas we have to make sense and are logical, perhaps we are living a breathtaking life without our own knowledge.
           Sometimes meaningless imagination makes a small breakthrough in our lives.
           With this work, we help keep their imaginations alive by visualizing and storing them in the world we created.
           The mere fact that the imagination exists will be both a pleasure and a small consolation to people.
           We planned this exhibition to show through this act that "thinking without meaning comforts us without our knowledge."

           <br><br><br>
           'Beyond Your Imagination'(2016) was displayed at Kookmin University in 2016.

            HOW TO ENJOY (MEUNAL)
          </h2>
          01. The audience stands in front of the hologram.
          <br><br> 02. There are questions that demand the imagination of the audience in front of them.
          <br><br> 03. Viewers can freely visualize their imagination of the question using Leap Motion sensor.
          <br><br> 04. The imagination of the viewer entered through Leap Motion sensor is stored in the world we have created.
          <br> &nbsp&nbsp (The hologram and the display is connected.
                If audience enter it in the hologram, it stores on the display.)
          <br><br>   05. Visitors who complete the entry will receive printouts such as postcards and stickers
          <br> &nbsp&nbsp which is written without "If it is scientifically clear that all the UFOs in the world are false, all humans
          <br> &nbsp&nbsp on Earth will be a little bit more lonely. “
          - from “A Common Being”(2009), written by  Seok Won, LEE.
          <br><br><br> 06. At the end of the exhibition, a new world is created by the imagination created by the audience.
          <br><br> 07.Viewers are comforted only by the fact that their imagination exists somewhere.

            TECHNOLIGY
          </h2>
            A screen made with fog and a Leap Motion sensor was used to complete this work.
            <br> The picture drawn by the audience appears on the fog screen(left-side screen) while they're drawing,
            and is stored on the right-side display when the pictures are completed.
            The 3D virtual world, made with Cinema 4D, is being operated by Unity Engine on the left-side screen during the exhibition.
            <br><br>Since the focus was on visualizing the audience's 'imagination' and showing the imagination as if it were real,
            we thought a fog screen that makes one feel like they're floating in the air is better than a 2D screen.
