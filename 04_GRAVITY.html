          <h2>
            MOTIVATION
          </h2>

          Why do humans look like this?
          Why are arms, legs, fingers, and bodies stretched out long without being rounded or angled?
          <i>GRAVITY: Where are you?</i> begins with our interest in appearance, and we continue to ask questions about the existence of human beings.
          <br><br>
          The answer to the previous question lies in 'gravity'.
          Planets and stars in space are round in shape because gravity is at the center of each of them.
          On the other hand, gravity is a powerful force that works from top to bottom for humans, a small creature on Earth.
          Therefore, human arms, legs, and bodies are all shaped like cylinders.
          <br><br>
          Tired of our busy daily lives, we forget why we look like this, what scientific facts we are living on, and dwell on what we see in front of us.
          But it is very important not to forget what you need to know.
          <br>
          "Gravity" is the world that humans have wanted to know for thousands of years, and it is the answer to the questions that countless people have asked.
          Therefore, this is what we should learn because it is worth knowing and what we should be aware of.

          This process of asking questions about our appearance and finding answers is,
          after all, an attempt to understand the Earth and the universe we live in,
          the same as understanding how we live and our existence.

            WORK
          </h2>
          <i>GRAVITY: Where are you?</i> is a work that deals with the characteristic features of gravity in everyday life with various materials.
          The main key word is <i>an effort to fly</i>, <i>shape of human body</i>, and <i>keystone on architecture</i>.
          Humans have spent a lot of time and effort to fly out of gravity for a long time. Despite the development of science,
          we still have limitations in our ability to fly, because we cannot escape gravity.
          <br><br>
          Our bodies are all shaped like cylinders. However, If we lived deep in the ocean, we might have a body close to the sphere.
          Due to the relatively weak gravity(one-sixth of the Earth), our height will grow on the moon.
          Keystone is the stone at the center of the arch, which plays an important role in enduring the force from all sides and supporting the arch from collapsing.
          <br><br>
          Each of three images are designed with these key words.
